# React To Do List

Project idea from [this post](https://medium.com/@rohan.fulzele/50-beginner-and-intermediate-level-react-project-ideas-%EF%B8%8F-809b396faa39)

Task: Create a simple to-do list app with features to add, mark as done, and delete tasks.

## Basic features

### Add task
Add a task to the todo list. The task will be initialized as "not done yet".

### Mark task as done
Be able to click an already existing task and mark it as done.

### Delete task
Be able to delete a task so that it is no longer on the list

## Additional features (ideas for now)
* Add a description to tasks
* Archive tasks
* Add due dates for tasks
